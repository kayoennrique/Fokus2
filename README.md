## Focus

![](print.png)


Our beloved project is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to add, edit, view and remove tasks, all in a pleasant and user-friendly visual environment. But make no mistake, despite its simplicity, it is the battlefield where you will train and improve your JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

## The Magic that the Project Performs

1. Add Tasks: A magic button reveals a form where you can write and add new tasks.
2. Edit Tasks: Click an edit button and voil√†, you can change the task description.
3. View Tasks: The added tasks are all there, nice and organized, waiting for your attention.
4. Mark Tasks as Complete: When a task is completed, it changes its appearance. It's the magic of CSS and JavaScript happening!
5. Remove Tasks: Be selective and only remove completed tasks, or throw everything away and start over with a clean to-do list.

## The Cauldron of Techniques and Technologies

This is where the magic happens! We delve deeply into the waters of:

- DOM Manipulation: We learned how to manipulate the structure of our page with JavaScript, creating, removing and changing HTML elements.
- JavaScript Events: We explore the power of JavaScript events to create an interactive and responsive interface.
- LocalStorage: We rehearse the dance of storing and retrieving data using LocalStorage, keeping our tasks safe and accessible even after the browser is closed.

## How to Open and Run the Project: A Treasure Map to Navigate the Code

Ahoy, sailor of the code! Are you ready to set sail and navigate the waters of our project? Hold on tight to the helm as we'll guide you through the steps to set up and run the project in your local environment. Don't worry, there are no sea monsters in sight, just an ocean of learning waiting for you!

### Fueling the Ship

Make sure you have a modern web browser installed. We recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

#### Navigating to the Project

Open the folder where the project was downloaded or extracted.
You will find a file called index.html. This is our treasure map!

#### Hoisting the Sails

Double click on the index.html file. Voila! The project will open in your default browser, and you will be transported to the enchanted lands of our task management application.

#### Exploring the Code Islands

Open the project folder in your favorite code editor. We recommend using Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

You'll find three main files that contain the code that makes the magic happen:

- script-crud.js: Where the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionalities of tasks are implemented.
- script.js: An additional script that can contain other JavaScript features of the project.
- styles.css: Where the beauty of the project is created, with all the CSS styles that make our application shine.

#### Adjusting the Candles:

Feel free to explore, modify and experiment with the code. The sea is vast and full of discoveries!

#### Messages in a Bottle:

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, don't hesitate to share your feedback.

Now with the map in hand and the instructions, you are ready to explore the waters of our project!

May the winds of learning always blow in your favor, and may you find treasures of knowledge in every line of code. Have a good trip, and until the next adventure!
